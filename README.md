# Specifications
1. The user is able to create their own account to manage notes and tasks. When the user is authorized, the program allows them to make use of the following features.
2. Note Taking part includes creating a note, editing, and removing it. Also, user can label and search each note by title or description. Last but no least, we can pin and unpin notes, so that important information is never lost.  
3. Task Managing includes creating a task, editing, categorizing, marking, and deleting the task. The tasks are shown as a calendar so that users can intuitively figure out how much they have achieved.

# Testing 
We have unit tests for our application to make sure there is no regression during new changes. They cover different parts of our application. Some of them interact with the database and some tests are basic (testing of constructors, getters & setters).
Possible improvement in this area: 
1) add a separate database for testing
2) integration & e2e testing
